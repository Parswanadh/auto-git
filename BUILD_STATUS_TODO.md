# 🚧 AUTO-GIT: BUILD STATUS & TODO LIST

**Last Updated**: March 12, 2026  
**System Status**: 🟢 FUNCTIONAL — 19-node pipeline with full execution policy coverage  
**Completion**: ~92%

---

## 📝 MARCH 24, 2026 IMPLEMENTATION DELTA (GitHub Copilot)

### P0 Fixing Plan Progress (Current Session)
- ✅ Deterministic import fix added for invalid `cryptography ... import signing` usage
   - rewrites to `from nacl import signing`
- ✅ Deterministic call-shape normalization added for `SIGNATURE_MISMATCH`
   - patches reported call-sites to meet min/max argument count
- ✅ Self-eval hard guard added
   - runtime `execution_errors` now force `needs_work` (no false approval)
- ✅ Alias mapping expanded
   - `nacl -> pynacl` in requirements normalization

### Validation This Session
- ✅ `python -m py_compile src/langraph_pipeline/nodes.py`
- ✅ `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_nodes_zero_cost.py -q -k "CryptographySigningImportAutoFix or SignatureMismatchAutoFix or renames_import_aliases"`
- ✅ `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_correctness_routing.py -q`

### Next Immediate Execution Step
- [ ] Run a fresh moderate E2E (`run_e2e_moderate.py`) and compare deltas against prior dominant failures:
   - signature oscillation around `create_todo`
   - invalid cryptography signing import
   - self-eval vs correctness gate consistency

## 📝 MARCH 7, 2026 EXECUTION LOG (GitHub Copilot)

### Actions Documented This Session
- ✅ Confirmed GitHub push was executed via GitHub CLI + git (`gh auth setup-git`, `git add .`, `git commit`, `git push origin master`)
- ✅ Re-checked main pipeline compile state — `src/langraph_pipeline/nodes.py` is currently syntax-clean again
- ✅ Preserved and prepared the outstanding `nodes.py` fix-loop repair for push
   - restores `_asyncio_fix` import in the fix-loop section
   - removes duplicate timeout wrapper logic
   - restores final artifact-strip + syntax-check block
- ✅ Launched sub-agents to investigate root causes of pipeline slowness from both:
   - static code analysis
   - docs/logs/runtime evidence
- ✅ Began bug-fix pass by correcting dependency gaps in `requirements.txt`
   - added `ruff`
   - added `bandit`
   - added `streamlit`
   - added `pandas`
- ✅ Applied first low-risk latency optimization in `src/utils/code_executor.py`
   - disabled pip version-check overhead in subprocess env
   - removed unconditional `pip install --upgrade pip` from every test cycle
- ✅ Started consolidated reporting for delay analysis and execution trace documentation
- ✅ Created `PIPELINE_DELAY_ROOT_CAUSE_REPORT.md`

### New High-Confidence Findings
- 🔴 Main slowdown is in the **back half of the pipeline**, not the front half
- 🔴 Biggest wall-time drivers are:
   1. repeated environment creation + dependency installation
   2. large LLM timeout budgets and fallback cascades
   3. repeated code review / test / fix loops
   4. multi-pass code generation and regeneration
- 🟡 Resource monitoring still exists but is **not integrated into the live workflow**
- 🟡 Validation is stronger than older docs claim, but some required tools were still missing from `requirements.txt`

### Immediate Next Fix Targets
- [x] Reuse a persistent test environment instead of recreating venv + installs every cycle
- [ ] Add node-level timing / timeout budgets to stop runaway slow stages
- [ ] Reduce or gate expensive review/fix loops after small deterministic fixes
- [ ] Integrate `ResourceMonitor` into `workflow_enhanced.py` and heavy nodes
- [ ] Verify MCP execution path end-to-end and update stale docs

### Local Development Progress (No GitHub Push Mode)
- ✅ Implemented persistent cached virtualenv reuse in `src/utils/code_executor.py`
- ✅ Wired cached env reuse into `code_testing_node`
- ✅ Wired cached env reuse into `feature_verification_node`
- ✅ Validated updated files are error-free
- ✅ Added incomplete-artifact quality gate in `code_testing_node`
- ✅ Added model client reuse cache in `src/utils/model_manager.py`
- ✅ Separated strategy-hash tracking from error-hash tracking
- ✅ Reduced unnecessary deep-review passes after deterministic/local-only fixes

### Major Speed + Quality Issues (Current Ranked View)
1. **Repeated environment/dependency setup** — now partially mitigated with cached env reuse
2. **Model client rebuilds on fallback path** — mitigated with `_client_cache`
3. **Placeholder/skeleton artifacts surviving too long** — mitigated with fail-fast artifact gate
4. **Static-only timeout states looking too healthy** — mitigated with explicit `static_only_timeout`
5. **Deep review overused after small fixes** — mitigated with smarter post-fix routing
6. **ResourceMonitor still not integrated** — still open
7. **Node-level timeout budgets still missing** — still open
8. **Prompt bloat / repo-map gap still open** — still open

### New Report
- See `SPEED_QUALITY_REMEDIATION_REPORT.md` for the consolidated issue list, fixes implemented, and remaining roadmap
- See `SOTA_PIPELINE_RELIABILITY_BLUEPRINT.md` for research-backed best practices, implemented reliability upgrades, and the path toward fully tested/evaluated SOTA-quality outputs

### Latest Reliability + Efficiency Upgrades
- ✅ Integrated resource-aware gating around heavy workflow nodes
- ✅ Added node soft-budget and hard-timeout telemetry
- ✅ Added `repo_map` artifact from architecture spec
- ✅ Switched cross-file prompt context to compact symbol summaries
- ✅ Added prompt budget tracking for planning/codegen/fixing
- ✅ Capped validator concurrency based on available RAM
- ✅ Added persistent Docker pip cache + fixed timeout cleanup
- ✅ Aligned model RAM config with real client reuse behavior

### Current Best Path Toward "0 Errors + Fully Tested/Evaluated"
1. **Understand input deeply**
   - research + architecture spec + repo map
2. **Generate with stronger structure**
   - targeted architecture context + interface contracts + prompt budgets
3. **Catch deterministic failures early**
   - placeholder detection + static validators + artifact stripping
4. **Runtime-test and verify**
   - cached env testing + feature verification + self-eval + goal eval
5. **Only then publish**
   - preserve explicit failure/timeout states instead of false passes

### Still Open
- [ ] Project-level validation reuse across fix cycles
- [ ] Changed-file-aware runtime test selection
- [ ] Stronger final publish gate requiring runtime-verified quality for more cases
- [ ] Repo-map integration into review/eval prompts
- [ ] Better paper/problem ingestion quality scoring
